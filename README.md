# WIDS_CV
# Project Overview
This repository contains the practical implementations and exercises for the Foundations of Computer Vision intensive course as beginner. 

# Week 1: Image Fundamentals & Processing
Understanding pixel representation and color spaces (RGB, HSV, Grayscale).
Applying Gaussian&Median blurring for noise reduction and analyzing image gradients.
Implementing Canny operators to identify structural boundaries.

**Implementation:**
`blur_filters.py` & `edge_detection.py`: simple code implementation that loads raw imagery, converts color spaces, applies kernel-based filtering, and extracts edge maps using the Canny algorithm.

For understanding the math behind those filters I referred opencv tutorials website. And for implemention in python and basic intro to cv youtube videos were helpful
